## The web rules

The web is special. It's incredible. Remember how things used to be?

> The web has everything we know on it, and you can read it all. **Nothing's stopping you**. Maybe the fact that that still blows my mind marks me as an old fogey, but honestly, how can that not blow your mind?

Something _is_ stopping people.

---

Accessibility shouldn't be a special effort

---

HTML is (generally) accessible by default.
Don't put up barriers by "improving" your product.

---

Accessibility is just a part of UX.

Not designing for specific disabilities but for a diverse set of use-cases.

---

Good design is inclusive

---

## Accessibility is for everyone

It benefits more people than you might think.

---

### Permanent impairment

- 10m people in the UK are disabled (~17% of the population)
- Half are over state pension age
- 4.5% of the population are colour-blind (9% of men)

---

### Temporary or situational impairment

Everyone benefits from good accessible design.

---

#### High contrast

_or_
me reading my phone in bright sunlight üòé

---

#### Captioned videos

deaf user
_or_
me when I forget my headphones at work üéß

---

##### One-handed navigation

user with one arm
_or_
me drinking a beer üç∫

---

## Don't make assumptions

Not all users are like you or your teammates

---

Not everyone _always_ has great eyesight.

Not everyone _always_ has a powerful modern device.

Not everyone _always_ chooses the browser they use.

**Design for everyone.**

---

## User personas

---

#### Colour-blind

May struggle to perceive the difference between certain colours.

- Do note rely solely on colour
- Allow customisation/colour-blind mode

---

---

#### Low-vision

May need to increase the text-size in my browser.

- Do not prevent zoom
- Scale UI based on font-size

---

---

#### Low-vision

May need to use a screen-magnifier.

- Show things in context
- Logical content flow

---

#### Blind

Need to use a screenreader.

- Information isn't solely visual
- Programmatic access to structured content

---

#### Hard-of-hearing

May struggle to hear things.

- Provide text alternatives to audio content
- Transcripts and/or subtitles

---

#### Deaf

Cannot hear anything. Sign language may be first language

- Subtitles can be hard to follow, may prefer signed content
- Option for non-phone communication

---

#### Mild motor-impairment

May struggle to use a mouse or touchscreen with fine control.

- Large interactive targets
- Lots of padding for links/buttons

---

#### Medium motor-impairment

Have to use a keyboard instead of a mouse.

- DON'T DISABLE FOCUS OUTLINES
- Logical document flow so focus doesn't jump around
- Ensure custom UI works without a mouse

---

#### Severe motor-impairment

Uses voice-input instead of a mouse or keyboard.

- Test interface with speech-recognition software
- Logical labels as they have to describe UI elements

---

#### Dyslexia

May struggle to process written text or spell.

- Don't require exact spelling
- Write content in simple English
- Clear subheadings to divide content

---

#### Autism

May struggle to process information.

- Clear, descriptive interface
- Avoid idioms or figures of speech
- Maybe prefer plain language and simple colours

---

#### ADHD

May find it hard to concentrate.

- Don't distract the user!
- No popups or alerts during important tasks

---

#### Memory

May struggle to remember previous information or get easily confused.

- Don't require memorising info from previous steps
- Avoid time-limits for task-completion

---

## How do we design accessibly?

---

### WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a set of best practices.
To meet guidelines sites should be:

- **P**erceivable
- **O**perable
- **U**nderstandable
- **R**obust

---

### Cheatsheet

The guidelines can be quite dry, so here's a cheatsheet:
[bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet](https://bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet/)

---

#### Perceivable

Can all users perceive your UI?

e.g. text with sufficient size/contrast/line-height, images with alt-text, alerting screenreaders to dynamic content.

---

#### Operable

Can all users operate the UI components and navigation?

e.g. ensure keyboard functionality, no unnecessary time-limits, descriptive link text, hierarchical headings, unique & descriptive page titles.

---

#### Operable

Can all your users understand the content and how to use the interface?

e.g. use plain English, set the `lang` attribute, label inputs, provide error messages in context.

---

####¬†Robust

Can your content be understood by different user-agents/assistive tech?

e.g. semantic HTML (and ARIA when this fails you), automated and manual testing.

---

## WAI-ARIA

Stands for _Web Accessibility Initiative ‚Äì Accessible Rich Internet Applications_...

A spec for assigning meaning to otherwise meaningless chunks of markup.

---

### ARIA gives divs superpowers

---

Useful where functionality is added with JS, when you're beyond semantic <abbr>HTML</abbr>.

Turn div-soup into something a screenreader can understand.

---

### Labels

Visually obvious content might need a text label.

e.g. `<button aria-label="menu button">‚ò∞</button>`

---

### Roles

Signifies your custom component as a type assistive tech can recognise.

e.g. a custom `<select>` using divs could use `role="listbox"`.

---

### Live regions

Ensures dynamically updated content is read out.

`aria-live="polite"` will be read once the current info finished, `aria-live="assertive"` will interrupt.
