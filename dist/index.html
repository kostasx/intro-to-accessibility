<p>The web is special. It’s incredible. Remember how things used to be?</p>

<p>The web has everything we know on it, and you can read it all. <strong>Nothing’s stopping you</strong>. Maybe the fact that that still blows my mind marks me as an old fogey, but honestly, how can that not blow your mind?</p>

<p>Something <em>is</em> stopping people.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>Accessibility shouldn’t be a special effort. It’s about building a product that as many people as possible can use.</p>
<p>HTML is (generally) accessible by default. Accessibility means ensuring you don’t put up barriers by “improving” your product.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>User-experience is everything for the products you build. Accessibility is just another part of this—designing for all the different ways people are going to use it.</p>
<p>Think of it not as designing for specific disabilities but designing for a diverse set of use-cases.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h2 id="accessibility-is-for-everyone">Accessibility is for everyone</h2>
<p>It benefits more people than you might think.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="permanent-impairment">Permanent impairment</h3>
<ul>
<li>10m people in the UK are disabled (~17% of the population)</li>
<li>Half of these are over state pension age</li>
<li>4.5% of the population are colour-blind (double that for men)</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="temporary-or-situational-impairment">Temporary or situational impairment</h3>
<p>Literally anyone can benefit from good accessible design. People get injured temporarily, or are in situations that limit the way they can interact with your product.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>Somebody with poor-vision will appreciate your high-contrast interface, but so will I if I’m struggling to read in bright sunlight.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>Captioning your videos means blind people can still experience them, but it also means someone bored at work can watch it under the desk.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>Ensuring your mobile navigation is all within easy thumb-reach obviously benefits somebody with one hand, but it also helps a user holding a baby (or drinking a beer).</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h2 id="don-t-make-assumptions">Don’t make assumptions</h2>
<p>It’s easy to assume that the majority of your users will be like you or people that you know.</p>
<p>This is unlikely, and untrue for most people at different times in their lives.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>Not everyone <em>always</em> has great eyesight.</p>
<p>Not everyone <em>always</em> has a powerful modern device.</p>
<p>Not everyone <em>always</em> chooses the browser they use.</p>
<p><strong>Design for everyone.</strong></p>

</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="visual">Visual</h3>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="colour-blind">Colour-blind</h4>
<p>I am colour-blind and struggle to perceive the difference between certain colours.</p>
<p>I need an interface that does not rely solely on colour to communicate information (or that provides an option to change the colours so I can tell them apart).</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p><img src="assets/img/football.png" alt=""></p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="low-vision">Low-vision</h4>
<p>I have low-vision and need to increase the text-size in my browser.</p>
<p>I need an interface that does not stop me from increasing text-size, and that scales proportionally when I do so (rather than completely breaking).</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p><img src="assets/img/nytimes.png" alt=""></p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="low-vision">Low-vision</h4>
<p>I have very low-vision and need to use a screen-magnifier.</p>
<p>I need an interface that shows things in context so I don’t have to go searching the page. It also helps to have a logical content-flow as I can only see one thing at a time.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="blind">Blind</h4>
<p>I am blind and need to use a screenreader.</p>
<p>I need an interface that does not present information solely visually. I need the content to be accessible programmatically so my screenreader software can access it and correctly describe the page to me.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="hearing">Hearing</h3>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="hard-of-hearing">Hard-of-hearing</h4>
<p>I am hard-of-hearing and struggle to hear most things.</p>
<p>I need content that is provided in a text as well as audio form, so I can read it rather than struggling to listen. This includes transcripts and/or subtitles for video/audio content.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="deaf">Deaf</h4>
<p>I am deaf and cannot hear anything.</p>
<p>British Sign Language is my first language, so I struggle to read and write English. Subtitles are difficult for me to follow so I prefer signed content.</p>
<p>I also need an option for non-phone communication.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="motor">Motor</h3>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="mild-motor-impairment">Mild motor-impairment</h4>
<p>I have mild motor-impairment and struggle to use a mouse or touchscreen with fine control.</p>
<p>I need an interface that doesn’t require me to exactly hit small targets to complete tasks. UI elements with lots of padding help me click them without frustration.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="medium-motor-impairment">Medium motor-impairment</h4>
<p>I have medium motor-impairment and have to use a keyboard instead of a mouse.</p>
<p>I need an interface that clearly shows the elements I am focusing with the keyboard, and doesn’t assume all users are able to click on things. A logical document flow also helps so my focus doesn’t jump around the page as I navigate.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="severe-motor-impairment">Severe motor-impairment</h4>
<p>I have severe motor-impairment and use voice-input instead of a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>I need an interface that works with my custom speech-recognition software and has logical labels so I can describe what I want to interact with.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="cognitive">Cognitive</h3>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="dyslexia">Dyslexia</h4>
<p>I have dyslexia and struggle to process written text or spell.</p>
<p>I need inputs that don’t require exact spelling to figure out what I meant. I also prefer content written in simple English that has clear subheadings dividing up sections.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="autism">Autism</h4>
<p>I am on the autistic spectrum and struggle to process information.</p>
<p>I need an interface that is clear and descriptive without using idioms or figures of speech. I also prefer plain language and simple colours.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="adhd">ADHD</h4>
<p>I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and find it hard to concentrate.</p>
<p>I need an interface that doesn’t distract me with unrelated pop-ups or information whilst I’m trying to focus on a task.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="memory">Memory</h4>
<p>I have a poor memory and get easily confused.</p>
<p>I need apps not to require me to memorise information from previous steps. I’d also rather not have a time-limit to complete a task.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h2 id="how-do-we-design-accessibly-">How do we design accessibly?</h2>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="wcag">WCAG</h3>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a set of best practices.<br>To meet guidelines sites should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perceivable</li>
<li>Operable</li>
<li>Understandable</li>
<li>Robust</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="cheatsheet">Cheatsheet</h3>
<p>The guidelines can be quite dry and hard to follow, so take a look at this amazing cheatsheet:<br><a href="https://bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet/">bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet</a></p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="perceivable">Perceivable</h4>
<p>Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive.</p>
<p>e.g. text with sufficient size/contrast/line-height, images with alt-text, alerting screenreaders to dynamic content.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="operable">Operable</h4>
<p>Can all users operate the UI components and navigation?</p>
<p>e.g. ensure keyboard functionality, no unnecessary time-limits, descriptive link text, hierarchical headings, unique &amp; descriptive page titles.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="operable">Operable</h4>
<p>Can all your users understand the content and how to use the interface?</p>
<p>e.g. use plain English, set the <code>lang</code> attribute, label inputs, provide error messages in context.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h4 id="robust">Robust</h4>
<p>Content should be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide range of user-agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
<p>e.g. semantic HTML (and ARIA when this fails you), automated and manual testing.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h2 id="wai-aria">WAI-ARIA</h2>
<p>Stands for <em>Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications</em>…</p>
<p>A spec for assigning meaning to otherwise meaningless chunks of markup.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<p>It’s usually used in web-applications where functionality is added with JavaScript, which goes beyond the capabilities of semantic <abbr>HTML</abbr>. It can turn div-soup into something a screenreader can understand.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
<p>If your content is visually obvious, but would be incomprehensible when read out by a screenreader you probably need to label it.</p>
<p><code>aria-label</code> lets you provide an extra description of an element: <code>&lt;button aria-label=&quot;menu button&quot;&gt;☰&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<p>If you are replicating native browser functionality with JavaScript, roles can add screenreader functionality.</p>
<p>For example a custom <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> using divs could use <code>role=&quot;listbox&quot;</code> to communicate its purpose.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h3 id="live-regions">Live regions</h3>
<p>Screenreaders don’t usually read out content that gets dynamically added to the page. <code>aria-live</code> marks a region to be watched and read out whenever the content changes.</p>
<p>Two values: “polite” or “assertive”. Polite will be read once the current task is complete, but assertive will interrupt.</p>
